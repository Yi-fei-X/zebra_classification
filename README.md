# zebra_classification

The dataset(http://vision.cse.psu.edu/data/ZebraDataset.zip) consists of a large number of photos of several hundred Kenyan plains zebras. For each individual, there are between 5 and 10 images. Each image is taken from the left-hand side of the animal, but the photos were taken on different days, with a variety of cameras, resolutions, distance-to-subject and lighting conditions. Some images feature more than one zebra, possibly occluded.

Project ideas: overall goal is to apply a machine learning approach to construct a classifier that,  given a freshly captured field image, can identify individuals whose stripe patterns have been previously learned, as well as identifying previously unseen individuals.
